    # ${3:Chart Title}

    ${4:Chart Name} Helm Chart for Kubernetes

    ## TL;DR

    ```bash
    $ helm install ${4:Chart Name}
    ```

    ## Prerequesites

    - Kubernetes 1.4+ with Beta APIs enabled
    - PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure (Only when persisting data)

    ## Installing the Chart

    To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

    ```bash
    $ helm install --name my-release ${4:Chart Name}
    ```

    The command deploys ${4:Chart Name} on the Kubernetes cluster in the kube-system configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the paramerts that can be configured during installation.

    > **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

    ## Uninstalling the Chart

    To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

    ```bash
    $ helm delete my-release
    ```

    The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and delete the release.

    ## Configuration

    The following tables list the configurable parameters of the ${4:Chart Name} chart and their default values.

    Parameter | Description | Default|
    --------- | ----------- | -------|
              |             |        |

    Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example:

    ```bash
    $ helm install --name my-release \
    --set key=value,key=value \
    ${4:Chart Name}
    ```

    Alternatyvely, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example:

    ```bash
    $ helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml ${4:Chart Name}
    ```

    > **Tip**: You can use the default [values](values.yaml)
